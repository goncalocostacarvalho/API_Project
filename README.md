- Project about API and/or Web Scraping analysis insert on Data Analysis Bootcamp from Ironhack

# Problem Statement
Nowadays everyone talks that old generation is finished and new generation is taking over it in football.
- Is that really right or people are talking without knowing?

# Hyphotesis
In football a team to be successfull needs experience. Teams with only raw talent take time to develop and to achieve theis goals.
## Assumptions
- Analysis was only made to Premier League teams
- If a team has an average age under 26 years old is considered an young team, if a team has an average age over 26 years old is considered an experienced team.

One of the goals is to make a comparison of the results and conclusions to real life
- Success :smiley:	 = time :hourglass: + experience :older_adult:	+ work hard :muscle:
